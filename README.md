# Scope+

Scope+ is the framework with realization in Covidscope (https://www.covidsc.d24h.hk/). Scope+ is a modern, scalable and novel web application framework developed as a community resource which serves as a generalized single-cell atlas portal archictecture. 

Existing single-cell atlas portal allow dataset-level browsing, no integrative cell-level browsing, while Scope+ provide efficient access, cell-level categorical selections and filtering of cells for meta-analysis for users who wish to use and adopt Scope+ to their own atlas data. Single cell gene expression data is sparse high-dimentional, the data query, retrieval and data visualization in Scope+ at cell-level granularity is accelerated by various computational optimization strategies, up to 1000 times faster. 

The development timeline for single cell atlas portal is around 1 to 2 years, with the help of Scope+, it can be streamlined to 2-3 days. Ultimately, Scope+ can translate any single cell atlases into a openly accessible data web portal for reproducible science, and making single-cell research data avaialble for community timely, this is particularly important for pandemics. 

The tutorial for implementation of Scope+ to adapt user's own atlas datasets is available at: [https://hiyin.github.io/scopeplus-user-tutorial/](https://hiyin.github.io/scopeplus-user-tutorial/)
