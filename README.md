# Scope+

Scope+ is the framework with realization in Covidscope (https://www.covidsc.d24h.hk/). Scope+ is a modern, scalable and novel web application framework developed as a community resource which serves as a generalized single-cell atlas portal archictecture. 

It provide efficient access, cell-level categorical selections and filtering of cells for meta-analysis for users who wish to use and adopt Scope+ to their own atlas data. The retrieval and data visualization in Scope+ at cell-level granularity is accelerated by various computational optimization strategies, 6-1000X faster. 

The development timeline for single cell atlas portal is around 1 to 2 years, with the help of Scope+, it can be streamlined to 2-3 days.

The tutorial for implementation of Scope+ to adapt user's own atlas datasets is available at: [https://hiyin.github.io/scopeplus-user-tutorial/](https://hiyin.github.io/scopeplus-user-tutorial/)
